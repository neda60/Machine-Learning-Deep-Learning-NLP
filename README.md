Deep learning for duplicate bug reports detection
This project is for detecting duplicate bug reports using stack traces.
Samples of recurrent Neural Networks such as LSTM and GRU were used. 
The code includes the latest selected model which includes 2 layers of GRU. The perfomrance of the model is measured by accuracy with a ranked list of top-k (k ={1,2,3,...,20}).
