contribut some debug pointer from user perspect to reproduc download the latest europa rcp edit g eclips rcp europa fall win zip start eclips the problem doe not occur switch to the plug in develop perspect exit eclips while the other not the java perspect is activ restart eclips the problem occur the freez occur depend on the initi workbench perspect there seem to be some nasti among mylyn and certain perspect dure startup have found that the pde and debug perspect caus the problem wherea the java and team synchron perspect don workaround go to window prefer general select startup and shutdown disabl the mylyn task ui with mylyn inact dure startup you avoid the problem have addit info notic that the team synchron and java perspect have someth relat to mylyn in common the both have view contribut by mylyn in their default layout the java perspect show the task list by default wherea the team sync show the task repositori to test whether this is contribut factor ad the task list view to the pde perspect and re start eclips inde the problem doe not occur in that case hope this help bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug we are in the process of evalu whether all the new duplic of this are relat to the platform perggen problem sinc sever of the stack trace contain the these warn in conjunct with permgen error we ve found way to almost reliabl reproduc the warn instal fall updat epp jee launch do not use or start ani mylyn ui or view instal some trivial updat and restart note error in log steffen and have outlin approach for address this without break api by tri to offload startup that current asynchron but appar block nad caus the warn in some scenario into separ job investig futher in repli to comment we ve found way to almost reliabl reproduc the warn this is onli semi reliabl way to reproduc the warn are still veri intermitt but are definit more to come up like if the restart is caus by an updat steffen fyi m near done with solut to this it goe along the line of our last discus this will be pretti huge chang which mean that the ui bridg plug in that add focus ui facil will have separ lazi load lifecycl that doe not get start until there is context activ these plug in will still be abl to do their usual extens point contribut g java stack trace url detector and start without initi their own extens point onc someth trigger the activ of task context happen then the focus ui facil load themselv the idea up until now wa that it wa ok for those facil to load themselv a long a they didn do anyth if no task wa activ but this wa still caus too much activ on startup signific portion of which wa happen synchron even though it wa in asyncexec due to the object lock that we found a per thoma watson comment on

this on fedora crap in repli to comment can reproduc this on fedora with access enabl of cours got gtk atk the atk bridg libspi and gail built this afternoon run that config on my ubuntu machin work

those platform m go to chang the target of this bug to and we ll work on fix for head but it too late now for confirm this bug on ubuntu howev work around this problem by switch from one jdk to anoth this solv the problem but onli to reoccur on logout login make the bug appear random bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug from one jdk to anoth this seem realli odd the bug is in the oper system not the jvm can you tell me the version of jvm that fail and one that work in repli to comment from one jdk to anoth this seem realli odd the bug is in the oper system not the jvm can you tell me the

to say jdk will caus eclips to work normal my observ is that it howev doe not matter which vm is in use just chang the vm caus eclips to behav normal it bit difficult to reproduc though bug ha been

seen the editor crash with some version and it may not be relat to this messag apdt weaver failur is separ bug report the messag doe not impair the function of the softwar a far a can see through user test and thought found in the latest releas version indigo wa work ok with no error messag but re read my report see that must have found case where indigo wa still send the error wa tri to look for version with all featur that work includ the apdt weaver but did not have ani luck will put up featur matrix somewher on web page so that we do not confus the differ bug in the differ version and to be clear what report is about what bug sinc m confus and eclips is veri big anyway think that can stand to weather the error messag just to use the other featur of eclips doe anyon on the list have

which seem to updat automat despit not request auto refresh could be indirect suspect the real except is be hidden or someth are you we at the point of tri trial and error solut if so d suggest increas the heap it shouldn need more but if it ha memori leak or someth might take longer to crash remind me of case use cruis control when we get frequent crash a we near mileston or releas at first assum it wa murphey law but turn out to be real memori leak on one particular page and logic enough a we near mileston or releas there were more peopl watch the build henc more peopl hit that page more frequent second if you want to experi more you might tri disabl class unload dure garbag collect while normal not recommend sinc this except seem to be about class not found it might make other error more appar like said trial and error if so for ibm vm the option is xnoclassgc quot disabl dynam class unload this option disabl the releas of nativ and java heap storag associ with java class loader and class that are no longer be use by the jvm the default behavior is a defin by xclassgc enabl this option is not recommend except under the direct of the ibm java support team the reason is the option can caus unlimit nativ memori growth lead to out of memori error quot ibm vm are known to be pretti aggress in their garbag collect so especi if heap memori wa too low it might unload more than other vms and might even caus thrash if the vm start load and unload class tri to make do with the memori it ha d doubl it last experiment suggest can get servic releas of ibm ppc java if you want to tri move up pure trial and error didn see anyth in the list of fix that would be obvious relat to this sort of problem le trial and error doesn seem much is log to hudson system lgos is there some set to log more know the whole stack trace is not present on the web page error and might give better clue if we knew the whole stack beyond that stop watch the build so much accident reset to blocker darn web browser ve chang the audit log to log at finer level instead of config level that wa onli log found and not sure it log ani web server activ anyon know where the web log is ad kim to this bug a well sinc know they are use hudson intern to help build the platform so she might have some addit idea a well david do think it is good idea to set hudson up with some initi heap larger than the default my rec would be to add xms xmx or someth similar to the rchudson startup script web master will need to be the one to do this a nobodi el ha necessari right to updat the script we may need to play around with the garbag collect set a you suggest a well hudson just crash again ve put it in shutdown mode to prevent new build until we can restart wouldn we want to revert to an older known good version of hudson realiz newer version fix some bug but at this point it seem hudson is total unus in repli to comment wouldn we want to revert to an older known good version of hudson realiz newer version fix some bug but at this point it seem hudson is total unus the problem here is the last know good version that didn have this problem is way back at build or someth like that plugin that we depend on like git svn maven etc all requir the latest version also within hudson this is onli an issu if use the ibm jvms everybodi that ha report this issu on the hudson mail list and on the bug link too earlier are all use an ibm jvm d rather either ditch the ibm jvms for run hudson not possibl unless we move the master server to one ofth newer machin or play with the set of the ibm jvm to see if we can get someth that work more reliabl in repli to comment hudson just crash again ve put it in shutdown mode to prevent new build until we can restart fyi manual kill the epp packag job sinc it had long time to go and would have to be re done anyway onc the runbuckybuild job is done would like the runbuckbuild job to finish hope our last one for the problem here is the last know good version that didn have this problem is way back at build or someth like that plugin that we depend on like git svn maven etc all requir the latest version are ani of those new featur requir for build requir for helio releas if not d also think revert is the best cours of action for our press prioriti in repli to comment fyi manual kill the epp packag job sinc it had long time to go and would have to be re done anyway onc the runbuckybuild job is done no problem hudson is up and run again in repli to comment wouldn we want to revert to an older known good version of hudson realiz newer version fix some bug but at this point it seem hudson is total unus deni can we tri ad the follow command line option to hudson to see if it help with the stabil with the ibm jvms xms xmx xnoclassgc anybodi more familiar with the set here feel free to chime in http publib boulder ibm com infocent javasdk r index jsp topic com ibm java doc diagnost html cmdline html ve ad those option to the startup file in repli to comment ve ad those option to the startup file okay on the next need to restart the server we ll see if these help or not sinc this is not the first time we ve had stabil issu relat to plugin upgrad ll offer some unwarr insight assum this instabl is not accept for all the eclips org committ if it is then plea disregard we seem to have two type of audienc use hudson the one who need stabl depend build system and those who want the bleed edg function and plugin of cours bleed edg with frequent upgrad and stabil are typic mutual exclus option we sysadmin face this dilemma regular where we must care balanc the need for up to date tool with avail from here can think of two option we all agre on what hudson is here to accomplish and determin which need it is not capabl of meet ie we find medium between stabil and function and we learn to say no to some plugin upgrad that may jeopard that stabil we maintain two build system where we me and matt one build system is stabl get upgrad infrequ and onli run minimalist set of plugin to get the job done the other hudson is free for all but use at your own risk here where you instal all kind of nifti plugin and function and restart hudson whenev you want matt and could maintain the stabl hudson and other can maintain the lead edg hudson but honest don want to maintain build system if for noth other than the potenti resourc consumpt this will incur on the server to the comment from deni today we use hudson just for test build howev we would like to move our build complet to hudson on build eclips org earli in stabil is extrem import to u my person expect is that hudson should be a stabl and the other softwar servic that eclips org provid bugzilla sign queue cv svn etc ll just voic this again ve been run hudson for over year on multipl site with various version the onli instabl have ever experienc ha been on the build eclips org master server my experi outsid of this environ is rock solid of cours ve alway use linux system with sun jvm or window system run sun jvm btw sinc we are in quiet period of build m go to restart with the latest chang done to the hudson build script so we can see if the new set help hudson now restart with the new set that matt setup in the startup script we ll see how this goe how difficult is it to swap the master and slave function also am part of the stabil audienc be concern about make sure the simultan releas get done think more stabil is need a well a clearer pictur of who need what for exampl project build that are part of the year simultan releas should get prioriti imho in world of limit resourc similar a impli in comment if the project in the simultan releas do not need those featur then don think we need to rush to includ them know there mani conflict demand and realli appreci your offer to maintain the stabl hudson guess we could say it been so success it ha gotten too big to fail also know that build eclips org is veri demand environ mani user heavi load which make stabil both more import and harder to achiev of cours bleed edg sandbox version would be nice but understand that is hard to do with limit resourc hardwar and manpow good luck in repli to comment how difficult is it to swap the master and slave function person d wait to do this until after helio is out the door you basic need to back up and restor the job and configur for hudson and restor on the master the bigger issu is that there are job that are hard code to run in specif environ now and download specif jdks target platform etc so it need to happen when there isn a critic releas schedul happen so that all user can get their job setup right with this said some of this will have to happen anyway a build and build come on line and again next step is to start elimin some plugin and get u to just what is disabl some plugin and get u to just the critic one that are be use when hudson restart there will be coupl of chang number of executor will be reduc from to sever plugin that aren critic to the usag of hudson will be disabl includ the ci game also if anybodi is interest in help to tri and find the caus and provid patch back to the hudson team ve got clone of the current code base at github you may fork from git github com kingargyl hudson git also look through the stack trace the onli plugin see in the stack trace that is not part of the core is the green ball plugin so ve disabl that a well david ha there been valuabl feedback on your suggest to use jre that is known to be stabl in repli to comment david ha there been valuabl feedback on your suggest to use jre that is known to be stabl eik unfortun we can do it unless we move the master machin to one of the newer build machin the reason is the build eclips org where hudson is run is ppc bit machin and onli ibm make jvm current that run on this architectur see comment earlier for some complic in just move everyth over to the newer build machin there will be some depend and job reconfigur that each project will need to make for more inform on this particular bug see the follow thread in hudson http hudson nabbl com error code when visit the main page for project td html okay see in repli to comment when hudson restart there will be coupl of chang is it just wait for job to finish befor restart pw m undo the depend on new build hardwar we had stabl hudson instanc not long ago and sinc dave suggest wait until after helio to make the master switch to new hardwar we can go in that direct now let continu on the path of revert chang and upgrad until hudson return to it previous stabl state this mean some project use some more recent hudson function or plugin may need to host their build separ until helio ha ship sorri but helio is the prioriti right now from here on d like to suggest few thing bug be open to request hudson updat we need from all the hudson admin befor updat includ matt bug be open to request new plugin we need from all the hudson admin befor updat includ matt we freez our hudson infra by m for helio this mean onc we return to stabl state we don touch hudson until helio is out the door if we orchestr this correct we should be abl to progress hudson on regular basi while not in releas endgam and still have an accur track of what ha been instal to facilit revers should thing go awri doe that make sen in repli to comment david ha there been valuabl feedback on your suggest to use jre that is known to be stabl m wonder what ha led to the conclus that this is vm bug is the vm crash or hang is the jellytagexcept

argument again sinc it essenti introduc memori leak all indic are that it a jvm specif issu all report case of this bug to the hudson develop are all use ibm jvms all case were fix by move to non ibm jvm and run hudson e the error stop occur ve been use hudson on multipl environ except with ibm jvms and have never had an issu or had this error occur and we run some pretti heavi load a well all indic are that it a jvm specif issu all report case of this bug to the hudson develop are all use ibm jvms all case were fix by move to non ibm jvm and run hudson e the error stop occur don want to get too philosoph here but correl doe not impli causat think it is best to use the vm differ a data point rather than jump to ani conclus it certain could be bug but there realli no one say that a far a know just that is occur on one vm not on anoth and you an say the same thing about hudson it occur on and after but not or befor more specif the develop of hudson say he think it wa introduc in version one user say they also saw it in version but not a bad the implic be to move back to or to get to safe version the develop said there wa chang in in the say tag librari can call each other which wa put in specif for some jellytag librari function someon wa tri to use sinc the link in their bug is wrong ll put it here found via googl http hudson nabbl com declar jelli tag lib in plugin and reus in anoth plugin td html there wa not ani technic inform provid but could imagin it involv some complic classpath issu even if we knew it hard to know if it wa the fix to allow jellytag to work or if it caus by the jelli tag librari itself onc it wa work but digress most want to clarifi correl doesn impli causat and summar what see a the recommend version where we current are probabl introduc the chang in behavior develop request run on this one and report if doe doesn occur one user report it did occur littl on but never on and anoth possibl import data point that surpris me on their web site they say their support version is it is not clear what that mean but assum it is like our eclips releas and these other build we ve been use are more like our build base on their frequenc so move back to or would not be too unreason if no helio project build depend on ani more recent fix it just happen again m prepar for shutdown there wa no job run when this happen wa abl to access job helio build click on one of the job then show full log that when it fail and chanc are that it wa this veri click that did it think chanc are high that nobodi el did anyth at the time it wa just second between my success attempt and the error it sunday morn and in europ the full log for helio is huge could that be the problem anyway hudson is restar if you go back to you ll have to manual find and instal all of the compat version of the critic plugin in u git scm adaptor note this ha ha sever bug fix that have been need by user of this plugin svn scm adaptor see note on maven plugin see note on ultim if somebodi can reproduc this local can give exact step to make it happen everytim can check out the hudson sourc code and more import provid patch back to the develop to fix the issu that is the best way to fix the issu and keep the need of all the project work have no problem if we want to setup virtual machin run on build or someth that can be stabl machin this may not necessarili be hudson issu itself but could also be bug with the jelli framework that it use a well sever project use the buckminst plug in sent question regard the backward compat to the author and m wait for repli on that one other thing that might be help the next time this happen is to get thread dump http build eclips org hudson threaddump also thoma doe this alway happen when you view veri long log file is it the same issu a the follow http issu hudson ci org brow hudson which is more to the consol log than to the job itself in repli to comment also thoma doe this alway happen when you view veri long log file no m sorri can reproduc it is it the same issu a the follow http issu hudson ci org brow hudson no the except wa the standard jellytagexcept and no build were access after that one thing to keep in mind is that if we do roll back to prior version that the current configur file will probabl not be backward compat so ani job may need to be setup on anoth server so just instal an older version of hudson may not necessarili be drop and go replac my recommend is to make the master server run on jvm that the hudson develop themselv test against regardless of the server architectur be use creat attach stacktrac it happen again attach the exact except if other do so a well we might be abl to see if they re all ident or if there is some hint in them a to where they are caus creat attach stack trace here mine for data point from http build eclips org hudson job eclips test but dif them and they re ident pw am get error when access the teneo texo build page http build eclips org hudson job emft texo night the main build page is access though http build eclips org hudson the last part of the stacktrac get on the project specif build page more ve put hudson in shutdown mode and ll restart it when the current job finish wow that wa quick see it again now is anyon keep track of how frequent these occur is there plan to fix this in repli to comment wow that wa quick see it again now is anyon keep track of how frequent these occur is there plan to fix this believ the web master have plan again best if we could get it fix at the sourc but don have way to reproduc this local or can find consist pattern for the hudson develop plea feel free to comment on the hudson bug http issu hudson ci org brow hudson for what it worth have tri set up hudson on my local machin to tri and reproduc this but to no avail but just did some basic job do no think could match the load the build eclips org server is under both in the work that done and perhap more import the number of peopl access the page is it possibl to move forward by go backward slowli set up second instanc of hudson use one of the older presum more stabl version of hudson and have some job move few at time this would allow those that don need ani of the new featur chanc to run on stabl version and test it out slowli who know we might find the older version ha the same problem this would perhap be le disrupt than an all or noth attempt to move everyth at onc to an older version if that the concern or reason for not do it alreadi m also puzzl by the lack of log inform so far all we have is the stack track that is display in the browser which doesn even give the whole stack for that portion that say class not found what oper start that whole thing that be pretti good clue no ve tri read the hudson doc and can find where this contain stack is log or how to control it in option m assum it is basic come from the winston contain anyon know is the full stack log somewher on server thank hi it happen again tri to run eef integr to build yes hudson is still or again respond same stacktrac like thoma face when tri to access http build eclips org hudson job egit and again in repli to comment is it possibl to move forward by go backward slowli set up second instanc of hudson use one of the older presum more stabl version of hudson and have some job move few at time wa talk with dave and it appear that if we revert to an older version of hudson most of the job would break and would need to be reset reconfigur although this error is wild annoy we do know that build work and so close to helio we thought it best to just restart semi work hudson instanc than to take shot in the dark with older version that we know will break build onc helio is out the door we ll tear into this more aggress btw know this error is frustrat but it unnecessari to post me too comment when the build page are in error when the system get into this state are there reliabl workaround e go to http build eclips org hudson to see the status of your build go to http build eclips org hudson job project buildnumb direct to see your page go to http build eclips org hudson job project build delay sec to launch new build if these were workaround then it might not matter so much at least to the peopl that track down this bug can we test them the next time hudson pw wa talk with dave and it appear that if we revert to an older version of hudson most of the job would break and would need to be reset reconfigur although this error is wild annoy we do know that build work and so close to helio we thought it best to just restart semi work hudson instanc than to take shot in the dark with older version that we know will break build well that is whi wa suggest second instanc to leav one alon while tri anoth but appreci you share your plan to do noth for helio releas well that unfair guess you could say your plan is to keep watch eye on it and restart it onc or twice day when the servic becom unavail that one way to throttl back server load mayb that ll be good thing and to do this until juli of this year when eclips is the onli one tri to releas good luck few peopl here have access to the hudsonbuild user account if you want to instal second instanc which will chew up few gb of ram be my guest manag hudson wa group effort until it fubar don get mad at me becaus you don like the way m mop up the mess in repli to comment when the system get into this state are there reliabl workaround e go to http build eclips org hudson to see the status of your build go to http build eclips org hudson job project buildnumb direct to see your page go to http build eclips org hudson job project build delay sec to launch new build the onli page that is direct affect is the main

manual through the url http wiki hudson ci org display hudson remot access api have to configur some job for rc could someon restart hudson plea hudson need to be restart again guess someon ha restart it it seem to be work fine look like hudson need to be restart onc more in repli to comment look like hudson need to be restart onc more yes seem to be unabl to access the main project page to kick

is happen again now see that no build are run so could it plea be restart and again restart now hit it again at http build eclips org hudson job eclips test pw it restart now give it few minut are these new failur an indic that they are not caus by the emma codecoverga report plugin which have disabl for my build while ago do you think can enabl it again in repli to comment are these new failur an indic that they are not caus by the emma codecoverga report plugin which have disabl for my build while ago it a general hudson issu in combin with ibm jvms http issu hudson ci org brow hudson thank you gunnar then will enabl the plugin again for my build achim demelt and have invest consider effort to integr coverag into buckminst and hudson again ve mark hudson for restart when the current build finish ll kick it hudson ha been restart look like it need to be restart again hudson ha been restart and again now that helio is out wonder if it possibl to experi with differ jres run hudson the issu seem to be specif to ibm jres hudson on sun jres seem fine note that the jre run hudson doe not have ani effect on the jre use for build ve restart hudson gunnar we re look at revamp our hudson setup so ll look into use your suggest again it been restart perhap we could setup littl script that hit the page everi so often and trigger restart when it saw the except we can call that the window solut have you guy tri heap dump again in repli to comment again seem to be work for me guess somebodi alreadi took care of the restart a side note it appear that the hudson dev are take an activ look into this again a there is activ on their side of thing again hudson just crash again it been restart error again ve put this into shutdown mode and will restart onc the job that are run are finish emf graphiti nigh ha been run for more than hour do noth sinc it seem to be stuck at the begin could an admin kill it to allow hudson to restart it restart now cannot access this singl build page http build eclips org hudson job modisco night the other job page seem to work m unabl to replic this cannot access this singl build page http build eclips org hudson job modisco night in repli to comment m unabl to replic this cannot access this singl build page http build eclips org hudson job modisco night yes it start work again after while but then today it happen again when tri to chang the job configur insid hudson like last time did anyon el experi this problem befor ve been suffer from the same symptom and ve found workaround so thought d share it absolut trivial to appli simpli use the follow jvm argument when you re start hudson xjit sun reflect generatedmethodaccessor invok ljava lang object ljava lang object ljava lang object disableinlin ve open bug against the ibm jdk to have perman fix creat in the meantim this should stop the bleed for all of u suffer from this problem in repli to comment one slight amend to my previous post in further test found that the actual number of the generatedmethodaccessor class could vari so to make sure hudson doesn continu fail in this same way use instead of g xjit sun reflect generatedmethodaccessor invok ljava lang object ljava lang object ljava lang object disableinlin test by write an ad hoc shell script that just hit job url use curl repeat without this option can make my local hudson fail after clean restart in just under minut after few more than hit bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug m go to restart the master to clear some dangl slave job at that time ll give joel suggest tri creat attach patch against upstream hudson so ve now figur out patch for hudson that if accept should obviat the need to workaround with ani jvm specif command line argument and yet still be portabl on all jvms creat an id on the hudson jira site but don seem to have permiss to add comment there so m post here again so it captur somewher public until can get access to comment direct against the hudson jira issu ve got veri straightforward procedur to reliabl reproduc the failur so test the fix is pretti quick and easi you can reproduc the bug with one liner shell script just replac the bit in bracket with valu to match the hudson instanc under test in my test it usual fail after just over iter le than minut count time while count lt do echo count curl http hostnam portnumb job somejobnam grep except if eq then break fi count count done my patch is attach let me explain what go on bear in mind that have not yet had my reason confirm by ibm jvm support but think it hold up the jelli file are tri to call class fornam string to load some class hudson model job and hudson model abstractbuild class fornam string doe not take classload a an argument so it ha to figur out the right one to use it doe this by make recours to nativ method that sniff the stack look for the caller class and it associ classload it doe this by look out frame hard code from the current point in the stack becaus jelli is an interpret environ it ha to invok class fornam via reflect which add stack frame to the stack trace m guess that the nativ method look for sun reflect generatedmethodaccessor invok to detect when it be call via reflect so it can discount those frame in count down but after the jvm ha been run for some time the jit decid that precis those method are be use enough to warrant inlin so sudden they no longer appear in the stack and so the wrong stack frame start get pick out of the stack trace instead of settl on the webapp classload it get the boot classload which can see anyth in hudson domain and thus we suffer classnotfoundexcept my fix to hudson modifi the jelli file to look up the context classload from the current thread instead of reli on class fornam chalk up anoth reason to avoid class fornam joel recommend creat github account and fork the offcial hudson instanc there http github com kohsuk hudson you can then creat branch with your patch and then request that kohsuk do pull from your branch to pull in your patch this may be the quickest way to get your patch appli and review from the hudson develop dave in repli to comment creat an attach id detail patch against upstream hudson so ve now figur out patch for hudson that if accept should obviat the need to workaround with ani jvm specif command line argument and yet still be portabl on all jvms creat an id on the hudson jira site but don seem to have permiss to add comment there so m post here again so it captur somewher public until can get access to comment direct against the hudson jira issu ve got veri straightforward procedur to reliabl reproduc the failur so test the fix is pretti quick and easi you can reproduc the bug with one liner shell script just replac the bit in bracket with valu to match the hudson instanc under test in my test it usual fail after just over iter le than minut count time while count lt do echo count curl http hostnam portnumb job somejobnam grep except if eq then break fi count count done my patch is attach let me explain what go on bear in mind that have not yet had my reason confirm by ibm jvm support but think it hold up the jelli file are tri to call class fornam string to load some class hudson model job and hudson model abstractbuild class fornam string doe not take classload a an argument so it ha to figur out the right one to use it doe this by make recours to nativ method that sniff the stack look for the caller class and it associ classload it doe this by look out frame hard code from the current point in the stack becaus jelli is an interpret environ it ha to invok class fornam via reflect which add stack frame to the stack trace m guess that the nativ method look for sun reflect generatedmethodaccessor invok to detect when it be call via reflect so it can discount those frame in count down but after the jvm ha been run for some time the jit decid that precis those method are be use enough to warrant inlin so sudden they no longer appear in the stack and so the wrong stack frame start get pick out of the stack trace instead of settl on the webapp classload it get the boot classload which can see anyth in hudson domain and thus we suffer classnotfoundexcept my fix to hudson modifi the jelli file to look up the context classload from the current thread instead of reli on class fornam chalk up anoth reason to avoid class fornam will do thank for the advic look like this issu will be final fix in the next version of hudson http issu hudson ci org brow hudson with hudson build this issu ha been fix http hudson lab org changelog would suggest that the webmast high consid upgrad to bring in the chang regardless if we are go to use an ibm jvm or not m go to close this a fix the new instanc is run an updat hudson and the sun jdk and the deprec instanc on build ha been pretti stabl thank to joel suggest just one addit updat had open pmr against the ibm jvm to fix the root caus that ha now been resolv and the fix will be avail in the upcom ibm sdk fp releas the relev apar are iz and iz don know what the schedul is for that releas but you can keep an eye out for it'\n",

while fix bug we decid to chang the dirti state on localresourcesaveablecomparison onli if the dirti state chang wa made to the site it refer to we were use fileel to distinguish that general everi localresourcesaveablecomparison should know to which fileel if refer to but in this case saveablecompareeditorinput that is creat by egit doesn pas it whi becaus it onli pas the element if it is suppos to control the full save lifecycl of them egit control the save lifecycl himself so our localresourcesaveablecomparison didn realli need the pointer to fileel howev wasn expect that this fix chang the dirti handl if we don know to which fileel doe the localresourcesaveablecomparison refer to all we can do then is best effort if ani of the site of input is dirti we mark saveablecomparison a dirti this work perfect when there is onli one edit side of compar editor but when there are two it may give fals posit result for isdirti howev if null wa pas to saveablecomparison than it the best we can do m think weather it might be good idea fix saveablecompareeditorinput a well localresourcesaveablecomparison won be tri to manag save fileel if it wasn return by saveablecompareeditorinput

test situat when left site is provid by saveablecompareeditorinput createfileel and in the other one it is fileel without addit function test behavior of dirti flag and save the left site of the

default maximum heap size they start to throw outofmemoryerror even if there is physic memori left on the machin final realiz it is not much consol but we have releas tool that help you recov from corrupt workspac it is avail here see the spi tool section http dev eclips org viewcv index cgi echeckout platform core home dev html sorri john there is no previous log but next time the workspac is corrupt tri your tool probabl this tool could be includ in eclip and ask at corrupt workspac for repair automat creat attach anoth user log file an interest clue anoth user report that they got this same messag when they accid open two eclips instanc on the same workspac this may be the caus of the error if one eclips write snapshot base on differ save state from the other instanc here is possibl scenario instanc start up load save tree from disk instanc start up load save tree from disk instanc shut down write save tree to disk instanc write an increment snapshot base on tree instanc crash on next startup it will tri to appli the snapshot on tree to the tree file from state this could veri well caus the problem creat attach log with previous outofmemori hi john ran into similar problem

the snap file also work around the problem for steve this suggest to me the step are make chang in the worksapc add delet file crash the workspac snap is delet on normal success shutdown move workspac restart here wa the stack trace in steve case bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug even without copi just after normal shutdown this also happen for build id debian version remov the snap file solv the problem but in bad way sinc all project are gone anoth bug that talk about this pain experi is bug are you abl to reproduc the issu on newer eclips version let say or ani mileston version am abl to reproduc this issu use eclips like ralf did not need to copi the workspac from one locat to anoth got the classnotfound except after eclips had an abnorm shutdown upon restart receiv the classnotfound except and delet the snap file wa the onli solut happen again the java file it claim to be miss is exact there suggest also mention the absolut path of the workspac you are look for the file mention in objectnotfoundexcept bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug had normal shutdown of version x geeg fthkndsp odxdthaou gfdpn dgb main use gwt delet the snap file fix this for me and everyth seem to be back to normal all project work and account for bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug rais prioriti a per bug am tri to find root caus of this issu but cannot reproduc the issu on window all report seem to be relat to linux so d like to ask if anyon wa abl to reproduc this bug on window the stacktrac is also interest savemanag fail after the workspac tree includ delta tree ha been rebuild and the last tree is be mark a the full one while all previous are go to be store a delta copi workspac into differ locat is not relev sinc all refer are workspac relat datadeltatre getdata will fail if the node wa delet even intent this lead u to deltadatatre asbackwarddelta which seem to be buggi it return alway datadeltanod with data but if the node wa creat in newer tree then after make newer tree a root the backward delta should have deletednod without content deletednod itself handl this situat where parent tree is copi so it is transform into datadeltanod creat attach the patch illustr my previous comment ani opinion are welcom ll tri to write some test later hope today in repli to comment am tri to find root caus of this issu but cannot reproduc the issu on window all report seem to be relat to linux so d like to ask if anyon wa abl to reproduc this bug on window the problem happen to steve on window but with the workspac on network drive it possibl the java nio lock doesn work in this case so it may be the same a the linux case bug comment describ my best guess at the caus for this if this is alway caus by multipl process use the same metadata think the solut lie in better lock sinc a soon a multipl process are oper concurr on the same workspac you re go to end up with lost or corrupt metadata anoth possibl is at least detect the metadata content in this case for exampl detect that we are appli the snapshot to the wrong tree and just discard the snapshot in that case snapshot is delta relat to some root tree and if you are compar to differ tree it is useless is it possibl that snap file is damag ll answer no it not possibl the except happen becaus the first restor workspac tree befor appli delta is empti and it is empti due to wrong snap workspac metadata plugin org eclips core resourc root xyz tree file where xyz stand for version in my case it is enough to renam that file from to and eclips start fine it look like the file tree is first written down and then the crash prevent workspac from save correct number technic it is possibl that if eclips crash in savemanag save line then the tree is written but the master tabl is not creat attach naivefix think that in savemanag restor would be good to check if the tree is non empti befor appli snapshot john ani comment can you explain what the fix is do don understand whi it is loop time and look up the same locat each time it doe not check the same locat actual becaus of true flag it check number of subsequ tree file if the tree is not found than we abandon chang and throw the except anyway but if the tree is found in reason number of iter arbitrari set to in the patch then we can assum that situat from comment took place in my testcas the differ between expect and actual file wa but think it can grow to infin krzysztof you told me that you are abl to reproduc the issu local plea describ the step so could verifi ani potenti fix defect cq wind er cq wind req cq wind this is still mark target ani updat the biggest problem with this issu is that normal user cannot use their workspac ani more unless they are expert enough to delet the snap file think we should fail more grace e allow open the workspac if at all posssibl and log the error such that later analysi can detect if when where or how often such failov happen ve had look at attach patch but like john wa confus you re take the tree for the current sequenc number and then you tri look at later futur sequenc number this seem odd wouldn it make more sen to tri look at older sequenc number or is there ani chanc to throw away anyth cach and rebuild the tree from scratch the workaround from comment just delet the snap file can we do the same in code also don understand the arbitrari restrict to sequenc number this is not relev for perform so whi not look at all the tree we have got the other question is what could have crash the workspac and thus creat the snap file in the first place can we do ani better log here for instanc if snap file is found tri find h err pid to look for backtrac creat attach log from crash workspac attach is the log from our custom crash workspac this wa on window host will attach the configur file next with the workspac on network drive drive they claim that the workspac had never been move but the log doe show the workspac exit with unsav chang in the previous session refresh workspac to recov chang creat attach configur of host winxp unfortun don have full zip of the crash workspac metadata to investig the tree hope to look at it again dure howev ani help is welcom updat have custom record of this problem happen with the workspac not be move and locat on local drive osgi instanc area file windriv workspac so regard john comment it look like miss lock and or multipl user access the same workspac is not the onli case where this can happen the custom log do indic the workspac exit with unsav chang in the previous session refresh workspac to recov chang but appar there wa differ reason for exit unclean in way that destroy the tree metadata so it could not be recov on restart this wa with eclips know that the algorithm for save workspac metadata should be such that they are alway consist even in case of an unclean shutdown but it look like there is hole somewher while code review may be the onli way find that hole suggest consid way for make recoveri more robust it not accept that all of eclips doesn come up ani more on restart becaus of this except at the veri least d expect eclips to restor with all workspac set such a prefer dialog set etc even if some of the project can be restor creat attach backtrac show problem user here just encount this this week with anoth possibl is that the user accident ran headless eclips applic concurr with their run ide in our case it veri like the problem occur when the user open the workspac use both the ide and cdt headlessbuild this didn until veri recent attempt to acquir the instanc lock what odd is that the instanc lock acquir seem to be in ideappl start the lock doesn seem to be acquir by the workspac itself or earlier in the startup process the result is that everi applic must acquir the lock explicit right dig bit deeper see that if you run antrunn say which doesn attempt to lock the instanc lock you can easili get into workspac open from multipl eclips instanc concurr what wors is that it seem imposs to lock the instanc lock if the applic plugin refer core resourc just notic this doesn work correct for headlessbuild acquir the workspacelock at the veri begin of headlessbuild start unfortun workspac open is get call first headlessbuild live in cdt managedbuild core the managedbuildcoreplugin is start and happen to regist an iresourcechangelisten resourcesplugin start workspac open the fact that referenc core resourc caus the workspac open to be call and there no check that the instanc lock is held by the current process mean it difficult to guarante that applic don accident open the workspac more than onc hm ve tri to fix the cdt issu by tweak the bundl activ polici bundl activationpolici lazi exclud org eclips cdt managedbuild intern core unfortun headlessbuild refer number of core resourc interfac still lead to core resourc activ on instanti without major refactor this would seem non trivial to fix perhap this workspac lock should realli be done by the platform file bug for the issu of headless iapplic caus resourcesplugin start workspac open lead to potenti concurr access to the workspac tree it seem that everi iapplic other than workbench that refer core resourc is vulner to this a the class plugin load lead to core resourc be start befor iapplic start is call so even if headless applic attempt to lock the instanc locat a the first thing it doe which few seem to it too late by the time start is call in repli to comment file bug for the issu of headless iapplic caus bug chang summari previous valu wa objectnotfoundexcept after copi workspac becaus know for sure that this issu happen for custom of our without ani kind of workspac move involv m still veri concern about this issu especi after get confirm from our custom that the workspac in question had never been copi no headless applic had ever been use while project had resid on remot samba share thehe metadata had alway resid local on document and set so it is safe to assum that lock had alway been proper the thing that worri me most is that eclips fail to open the workspac although restor the workspac is possibl by delet the snap file especi a long a we don know for sure what is caus this issu strong think that we should make everi effort possibl on startup to not just fail with the except but log the except and tri to repair the inconsist move to for further investig creat attach patch differ approach work in progress the patch will tri to fix the inconsist between master tabl and the tree name this is not test just show my current approach btw the problem is not trigger by workspac copi in my opinion it is save problem where master tabl is out of sync with the actual tree file name this may happen if save fail becaus e network drive had been disconnect thank for continu this work actual had veri differ idea for approach this what if for start we just chang the error messag to someth like we are sorri eclips fail to start due to an inconsist in your workspac plea zip up your wsdir metadata folder and attach the archiv on http bug eclips org bug show bug cgi id along with descript of your last step when close this workspac to help u investig understand and solv this problem after zip up your workspac you can delet the snap file in order to revert to the last known good configur such that your workspac should come up again essenti the idea is involv our end user in the analysi sinc we are still bit clueless a to what realli trigger the issu ha someth like this ever done befor at eclips doe it sound accept perhap for an sr releas anoth user hit this without open the workspac concurr they think they close the workspac on one machin and re open it on anoth both server use the same nfs mount so the caus could have been nfs sync issu in repli to comment after zip up your workspac you can delet the snap file the two time ve done this the workspac doe open but all project are miss re import them lose some of the resourc metadata such a which resourc are deriv when you delet the snap file do you not also lose all the project in the workspac jame if your user still ha the workspac can you have him zip it up for my custom this issu clear happen on window without ani nfs involv on the metadata wa on but the project content wa on remot samba share accord to comment there seem to be at least some case where delet the snap file recov but ve also heard other comment that the project were lost when do so in fact my accept criterion for workaround until the origin caus of this is found is that we must avoid loss of data in repli to comment jame if your user still ha the workspac can you have him zip it up m afraid it wa coupl week ago and we didn preserv the workspac this is veri rare issu for u but if when it happen again ll be sure to tar it up for analysi snap file contain recent modif of the file between two workspac save this issu is trigger by the lack of workspac state on the top of which the snap should be appli this result in except and prevent resourc from start no other plugin especi the product definit cannot be start if it depend on plugin which fail to start a have said befor snap file contain modif to some resourc but workspac tree is empti delet snap file bring the whole resourc back to consist empti state therefor do not believ that delet snap file is proper workaround it is just way of allow eclips to start bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug had coupl of our user hit

attempt at duplic the issu have fail so far am tri to see if the user is still abl to reproduc this issu might be abl to get the workspac that trigger the except howev this workspac wa generat with an old version of eclips that ha some custom modif thus am not sure how much help it will be buildid i have exact the same issu eclips report org eclips core intern dtree objectnotfoundexcept tree element simulatortest class not found the correspond java file wa the last file edit and save under eclips but the file exist even if remov the file and forc it recompil that doesn help can remov the snap file but it not solv the problem eclips crash regular with no reason earlier had similar problem when tri to commit veri larg binari file to svn repositori it succeed but the next time wa start eclips it crash report the commit file in objectnotfoundexcept creat attach an org eclips core resourc workspac that crash eclips rcp in case no one ha submit broken workspac with the problem snap file here goe we got this from user of our rcp app it will generat the except in eclips or ani app use org eclips core resourc imagin remov the project folder to reduc zip file size it doesn seem to matter where you put this in term of replic the objectnotfoundexcept the origin user path wa user aaron treeag workspac bug ha been mark a duplic of this bug ani updat this is one of the nastiest issu m current awar of get closer to solut would be awsom even if that get closer onli employ ad log facil to get more data ideal the workspac attach by andi ha what need though szymon ha been investig the issu he will updat the bug when he ha anyth to report have gone through all relat bug and here are some fact about the problem bug mark a duplic of this bug problem occur sinc eclips both on linux and window in differ version workspac store local no workspac move user confirm that there wa crash or hard close oom killal power down user claim there wa no crash but we cannot tell if the workspac wa correct close just to sort out terminolog issu there were differ name convent in those bug so to make it straight when refer to crash mean the crash that happen befor objectnotfoundexcept objectnotfoundexcept is not crash itself it just inabl to start the workspac sinc we can see snap file we can assum that previous eclips launch session wa not correct final know that the state of workspac is the state of workspac at some point in time just befor the crash have seen two broken workspac and in both case the workspac wa not consist to be precis the state of master tabl wa not consist look at the workspac upload by andi in comment you can see that master tabl consist of three chunk with the follow valu order preserv unrel entri skip tue mar pst tree tue mar pst tree tue mar pst tree in root folder you can see onli tree file master tabl is java util properti instanc which mean that latest key valu entri overrid previous entri in this case we would end up with tree a the current one when start the workspac eclips tri to use snap to updat tree file point by master tabl in this case it cannot find tree so tree updat is not success and we get objectnotfoundexcept have this inform we can assum that if the crash happen befor the master tabl would have been in sync with tree file sinc we cannot prevent from extern trigger crash killal power down etc we have to make sure that the state of workspac is consist at ani point in time it look that current it is not this confirm that we have hole somewher a mention by martin in comment at the moment do not know the step that lead to this situat but there are at least two issu that bother me in savemanag restoremastert we are creat new master tabl this method is access in catch claus from differ thread with non conflict project rule think there should be onli one instanc of master tabl it would be better to so someth like this if mastert null mastert new properti el mastert clear this would also prevent from use old master tabl valu if we call getmastert it is possibl to call savemanag save full save project monitor and in this case we would have two thread modifi master tabl increment sequenc number for root and creat new tree for root we could prevent from that by chang the rule to workspac root if full save wa request will tri to find the real step that can introduc such inconsist in master tabl about the workaround delet snap mean we do not need to updat the tree and sinc there is no tree file point by master tabl it start with clean tree delet is not proper workaround the onli proper manual workaround is to chang to in latest entri in file workspac metadata plugin org eclips core resourc safet org eclips core resourc use this this workaround we are not lose ani inform in broken workspac there are alway three chunk in master tabl file full save creat alway new master tabl file and two new chunk with veri close timestamp so the third chunk is most like save dure snapshot in andi workspac found the file workspac metadata plugin org eclips core zip which contain master tabl file and snap with modif time match the timestamp in the last chunk this impli that just befor there wa snapshot taken that creat snap file and invalid master tabl file at the moment we know that master tabl is corrupt by snapshot job in andi case the remain question is how it wa possibl that snapshot job had older entri in master tabl in anoth broken workspac master tabl file ha the follow entri thu oct cest tree thu oct cest tree thu oct cest tree there is onli one tree file for root tree modif time for tree is and for snap it is it look that snapshot is the culprit also in this case in log from andi workspac there are except log in the same session when snapshot occur accord to timestamp but about hour after the snapshot it look like the problem with wrong entri in master tabl file is not someth unusu and after it happen eclips still work normal this can impli that master tabl file is not in sync with master tabl kept in memori becaus of ugli snapshot it may happen more often but sinc each full save recreat master tabl file we may not know when we modifi master tabl in the wrong way we see the problem onli when we crash the workspac with not in sync master tabl file onli then dure next eclips startup master tabl is reconstruct from the file with wrong valu creat attach patch this patch solv two problem make it possibl to start eclips if master tabl is corrupt if it happen stack trace with messag will be log and eclips will use the greatest sequenc number for root to load the tree prevent from master tabl corrupt in the futur by throw an except this way we should not fall into problem if crash occur you may appli the patch and tri to open andi workspac we still do not have step to recreat the origin scenario but solv abov problem should prevent from that and log except when it happen comment are welcom receiv anoth workspac from custom that exhibit this the problem wa most like introduc due to crash we first tri to delet snap file which allow to open the workspac but project wa not list and some resourc file were not access then we tri the workaround that szymon

client git client gradl ide and startexplor instal have reproduc use fresh download eclips sdk alon my screen resolut is might help to know have this issu on onli of or so vms run cento under vmware onli differ between the fail one and the other is the use of egit jgit martin yes just the step that you say in repli to liad yosef from comment what step will reproduc the problem click outsid java file text editor out of focus for exampl click in the packag explor click back insid the java text editor happen onli on java editor not xml cs etc error is thrown doe this problem happen right after start up eclips or doe it take some time to happen am tri to determin whether it is slow leak it happen right after startup you start eclips one clic in packag explor anoth one in java editor and the error popup is thrown for me it a slow leak few hour but consist theoriz in bug comment that there at least differ way text layout can caus no more handl error fast one that rapid use all avail graphic context dure paint which can reproduc on window and slower one that leak text editor ui object and doesn seem to lead to no more handl on window at all appar onli limit be avail memori can reproduc the issu report in comment with an ident stack trace it is reproduc instant on startup not slow leak suspect this bug is get pull off track by multipl differ issu the poster report slow leak and differ stack trace should file other bug so that these distinct issu can be track proper these are also import but differ bug this appear relat to multipl monitor do not use teamview or displayfus but it doe seem plausibl to me that they are relat to the problem sinc it onli show up for me with certain multi monitor set enabl in my video driver here is how can reproduc it of the time eclips build version build id fresh instal no addit plugin o run window video card nvidia geforc gtx monitor run three ident monitor at to reproduc use these step you need nvidia surround mode which is onli support on gtx or better with three monitor that use ident time open the nvidia control panel set configur surround physx click the span display with surround checkbox click configur go through the wizard in case it matter wa use three monitor enabl pixel bezel correct but wa not use bezel correct at the time the crash occur now go to the window control panel and verifi that window think you have one enabl monitor run at and two disabl monitor think this is resolut relat but in case it matter wa run at hz refresh rate open eclips and follow the step from comment open java file click outsid the java editor click back insid the java editor you ll see the swt error with the stack trace from comment immedi if you go back to the nvidia control panel and disabl surround mode the problem goe away restart eclips and you can click into or out of the java editor without caus the crash if anyon is activ work on this and need help reproduc it feel free to email me offlin or ping me
